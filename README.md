# Donpen Downloader
## What is?
When I landed to Japan, I noticed the Donkihotte Stores and more precisely I "fell in love" for the Donkihotte mascotte: Donpen.

Lately I saw that on the Donkihotte website there are different Donpen's image with different clothes and outfits.

So I created a script to download them.

## Prerequisites
- Bun (My favorite JavaScript engine)

## How to run it
- Clone the repository (most necessary and easy step)
- Create a folder inside the project called `mascottes`
- Install all the project dependencies:
  ```
  bun i
  ```
- Execute the script
  ```
  bun index.ts
  ```
